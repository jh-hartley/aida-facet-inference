### Example 0: CERTAIN - Definitionally impossible for any other value
Allowed values: ["3", "4", "5"]
```json
{
  "attribute": "Number of steps",
  "recommendation": "3",
  "unit": "",
  "confidence": 0.995,
  "missing_value": "",
  "reasoning": "The product is described as 'This is a 3-step aluminum step ladder, model SL-3000.' The only possible value is 3."
}
```

### Example 1: VERY_HIGH - Direct evidence or world knowledge
Allowed values: ["Internal", "External"]
```json
{
  "attribute": "Location",
  "recommendation": "Internal",
  "unit": "",
  "confidence": 0.963,
  "missing_value": "",
  "reasoning": "The product description explicitly states 'suitable for internal use' and it's categorized as an interior door."
}
```

### Example 2: HIGH - Strong indirect evidence, EAN recall
Allowed values: ["Pine", "Oak", "MDF"]
```json
{
  "attribute": "Material",
  "recommendation": "Pine",
  "unit": "",
  "confidence": 0.902,
  "missing_value": "",
  "reasoning": "The product name includes 'Pine', the description mentions 'pine construction', and the EAN matches a well-known pine door in my training data."
}
```

### Example 3: MODERATE - Educated guess, world knowledge
Allowed values: ["Hollow", "Solid", "Panelled"]
```json
{
  "attribute": "Construction type",
  "recommendation": "Hollow",
  "unit": "",
  "confidence": 0.784,
  "missing_value": "",
  "reasoning": "While not explicitly stated, louvre doors of this type are typically hollow construction to reduce weight. This is a common industry standard for interior louvre doors."
}
```

### Example 4: LOW - Weak inference, best guess
Allowed values: ["White", "Natural", "Grey"]
```json
{
  "attribute": "Colour group",
  "recommendation": "White",
  "unit": "",
  "confidence": 0.537,
  "missing_value": "",
  "reasoning": "There is no mention of colour in the product details. 'White' is a common finish for interior doors, but this is a guess."
}
```

### Example 5: VERY_LOW - Minimal evidence, placeholder
Allowed values: ["Standard", "Custom"]
```json
{
  "attribute": "Installation type",
  "recommendation": "Standard",
  "unit": "",
  "confidence": 0.091,
  "missing_value": "",
  "reasoning": "There's no specific information about installation. This is a guess based on it being a standard interior door, but could be incorrect."
}
```

### Example 6: Cannot make prediction (confidently assert no label applies)
Allowed values: ["FD30", "FD60"]
```json
{
  "attribute": "Fire rating",
  "recommendation": "",
  "unit": "",
  "confidence": 0.981,
  "missing_value": "",
  "reasoning": "The product is clearly not fire-rated and none of the allowed values are appropriate for this type of door."
}
```

### Example 7: Value not in allowed list, EAN recall
Allowed values: ["Wood", "Metal", "Plastic"]
```json
{
  "attribute": "Material",
  "recommendation": "",
  "unit": "",
  "confidence": 0.941,
  "missing_value": "Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene",
  "reasoning": "The product is clearly made of ABS (name, description, and attributes all confirm this), and the EAN matches an ABS product in my training data, but 'Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene' is not in the allowed values list. While 'Plastic' is a general category, the specific material is important for this technical product."
}
```

### Example 8: Numeric value with units
Allowed values: ["12", "14", "16"]
```json
{
  "attribute": "Length",
  "recommendation": "12",
  "unit": "inches",
  "confidence": 0.923,
  "missing_value": "",
  "reasoning": "The product is a leather holster, which typically has a length that accommodates tools or items it is designed to hold. While the exact length is not specified in the product details, 12 inches is a common length for holsters and fits within the allowed values. This is an educated guess based on typical dimensions for similar products."
}
```

### Example 9: Numeric value with units in allowed value
Allowed values: ["12 inches", "14 inches", "16 inches"]
```json
{
  "attribute": "Length",
  "recommendation": "12 inches",
  "unit": "inches",
  "confidence": 0.923,
  "missing_value": "",
  "reasoning": "The product is a leather holster, which typically has a length that accommodates tools or items it is designed to hold. While the exact length is not specified in the product details, 12 inches is a common length for holsters and fits within the allowed values. This is an educated guess based on typical dimensions for similar products."
