### Example 0: CERTAIN - Definitionally impossible for any other value
Allowed values: ["3", "4", "5"]
```json
{
  "attribute": "Number of steps",
  "recommendation": "3",
  "unit": "",
  "confidence": 0.995,
  "suggested_value": "",
  "reasoning": "The product is described as 'This is a 3-step aluminum step ladder, model SL-3000.' The only possible value is 3."
}
```

### Example 1: VERY_HIGH - Direct evidence or world knowledge
Allowed values: ["Internal", "External"]
```json
{
  "attribute": "Location",
  "recommendation": "Internal",
  "unit": "",
  "confidence": 0.963,
  "suggested_value": "",
  "reasoning": "The product description explicitly states 'suitable for internal use' and it's categorized as an interior door."
}
```

### Example 2: HIGH - Strong indirect evidence, EAN recall
Allowed values: ["Pine", "Oak", "MDF"]
```json
{
  "attribute": "Material",
  "recommendation": "Pine",
  "unit": "",
  "confidence": 0.902,
  "suggested_value": "",
  "reasoning": "The product name includes 'Pine', the description mentions 'pine construction', and the EAN matches a well-known pine door in my training data."
}
```

### Example 3: MODERATE - Educated guess, world knowledge
Allowed values: ["Hollow", "Solid", "Panelled"]
```json
{
  "attribute": "Construction type",
  "recommendation": "Hollow",
  "unit": "",
  "confidence": 0.784,
  "suggested_value": "",
  "reasoning": "While not explicitly stated, louvre doors of this type are typically hollow construction to reduce weight. This is a common industry standard for interior louvre doors."
}
```

### Example 4: LOW - Weak inference, best guess
Allowed values: ["White", "Natural", "Grey"]
```json
{
  "attribute": "Colour group",
  "recommendation": "White",
  "unit": "",
  "confidence": 0.537,
  "suggested_value": "",
  "reasoning": "There is no mention of colour in the product details. 'White' is a common finish for interior doors, but this is a guess."
}
```

### Example 5: VERY_LOW - Minimal evidence, placeholder
Allowed values: ["Standard", "Custom"]
```json
{
  "attribute": "Installation type",
  "recommendation": "Standard",
  "unit": "",
  "confidence": 0.091,
  "suggested_value": "",
  "reasoning": "There's no specific information about installation. This is a guess based on it being a standard interior door, but could be incorrect."
}
```

### Example 6: Cannot make prediction (confidently assert no label applies)
Allowed values: ["FD30", "FD60"]
```json
{
  "attribute": "Fire rating",
  "recommendation": "",
  "unit": "",
  "confidence": 0.981,
  "suggested_value": "",
  "reasoning": "The product is clearly not fire-rated and none of the allowed values are appropriate for this type of door."
}
```

### Example 7: Value not in allowed list, EAN recall
Allowed values: ["Panelled", "Flush", "Moulded"]
```json
{
  "attribute": "Door style",
  "recommendation": "",
  "unit": "",
  "confidence": 0.941,
  "suggested_value": "Louvre",
  "reasoning": "The product is clearly a louvre door (name, description, and attributes all confirm this), and the EAN matches a louvre door in my training data, but 'Louvre' is not in the allowed values list. This appears to be an error in the allowed values."
}
