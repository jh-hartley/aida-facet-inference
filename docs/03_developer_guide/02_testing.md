# Testing Guide

> **Note:** This file is largely a placeholder due to the short timeframes of the project. Comprehensive testing documentation and coverage is a future goal as the project matures.

This document will describe the testing philosophy, how to run tests, and how to add new ones.

## Summary
- Types of tests (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- How to run the test suite
- How to add new tests

## TODO
- Add examples for writing tests
- Document test coverage requirements
- Explain use of fixtures and test data
